The final phase is **filling in the files**. This is the core coding part of the process, where you write the actual logic and implementation. This is done by:

- Starting with the most **critical or fundamental** parts of the project and working your way up.
- Writing the code for each function and method, ensuring it performs its intended task.
- **Testing** each component as you go. This is a continuous process, not just something done at the end.
- Writing **documentation** and **comments** to explain complex parts of the code.

By following this four-step process, you ensure a solid foundation, avoid getting lost in the details early on, and create an organized, maintainable project.

This is the final, hands-on coding phase. You'll tackle one specific task at a time, and the AI can provide the implementation.

- **Your Input (Required):**
  - **Specific Task:** Choose a single component or function to work on and provide a detailed description of its purpose. For example, "Create a function `create_user` that takes a username and password and stores them in the database."
- **AI's Role (Assistance):**
  - The AI can generate the code for this specific task based on your description. It can also help you debug, optimize, or write test cases for your code.
- **Prompt Example:** "Write a **\[Your Chosen Language]** function `create_user(username, password)` that inserts a new user into a **\[Your Database Type]** database table named 'users'. The table has `id`, `username`, and `password` columns. Include basic error handling."
