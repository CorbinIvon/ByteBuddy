The **skeleton phase** is where you translate the outline into actual code. You create the project's directory structure and all the necessary files, but you don't write the full logic yet. This involves:

- Creating **folders** for different modules (e.g., `src/`, `tests/`, `docs/`).
- Creating **empty files** or files with minimal, placeholder code (e.g., a `main.py` with just `print("Hello, world!")` or a class definition with an empty constructor).
- Defining the **function and method signatures** (their names and parameters), but leaving the body of the function empty or with a `TODO` comment.

This step ensures the project's structure is sound before you begin writing the bulk of the code, making it easier to integrate different parts later.

In this phase, you'll create the empty file and function structure. The AI will generate the boilerplate code, saving you time and ensuring consistency.

- **Your Input (Required):**
  - **File/Module Names:** List the specific files and modules you've decided on (e.g., `main.py`, `database.py`, `auth_utils.py`).
- **AI's Role (Assistance):**
  - The AI will generate the basic skeleton code for these files, including class and function definitions with docstrings and placeholders (`pass` statements or `TODO` comments).
- **Prompt Example:** "Generate the skeleton code for my project in **\[Your Chosen Language]**. The directory structure should include a **`main`** file and modules for **`database`** and **`user authentication`**. Use placeholder comments like `// TODO: Implement logic`."
